          <p style="padding-right: 2.5%; padding-left:2.5%;">On a smoggy, rainy day, I discovered my passion for <b>GIS</b>, bridging my love for <b>Geo Physics</b> and the booming tech landscape. After a month of soul-searching and research in <b>Bloomberg and Upwork</b>, I found the convergence of <b>IT, GIS, and AI</b>, foreseeing a $6+ trillion industry by 2030. This independent, <b>pivotal decision</b> resonates as a commitment to a path that encapsulates my intrigue and a profound responsibility for shaping my future.. 
            <br></br> My name is <b>Muhammed Hamza</b> and I am from Sadiqabad, South Punjab, Pakistan from a very remote village <b>Chak number 158p</b>.  I like <b>Kabaddi</b> in sports and <b>Pencil Sketching</b> is my hobby. My extra curricular activities also include as an active member of <b>Society of Geographic Information System and Remote Sensing</b>. I was one of founders of this society and currently this society has more than <b>1000 Members</b> who are actively contributing to <b>GIS community</b> in all across Pakistan having its base station in <b>Arid University</b>. 
            1st year at University was mostly gone in confusion (about decision), bulky assignments and chasing for 7 lectures per day. It made me though theoratically rich in GIS.
            
            <br></br> <b>Real Geospatial Engine</b> started inside me when I was in the start of my 2nd Year. After talking to a GIS Prof from <b>University of Washington (Gregory Lund)</b>. Passionately started taking free lectures from <b>MIT Open Course Ware, Edx & Coursera</b>.
            
            <br></br>In the mid of 2nd year I started my part time freelance at <b>Fiverr</b>. This decision entirely changed my life from despair & confusion to poise & certitude. I was offering basic <b>Geo Cartographic Services</b> like <b>MAP DESIGN, GEOCODING, DATA COLLECTION, GEOPROCESSING & SPATIAL ANALYSIS.</b> Clients were from countries like <b>USA, Canada, UK and Australia mostly</b>. These people were giving me tasks from their jobs and projects they taught me alot more than books and tutorials. <b>The real magic was that I was solving real world probelms</b>. It was something different everyday, I was making webapps for <b>#Agriculture</b> where they needed to measure the crops area interactively, making dashboards for <b>John Hopkin University</b> project, processing drone datasets on <b>WebODM</b>, creating a Virtual <b>3D Town using City Engine</b>, <b>911 Call prediction using GWR</b> (Geographic Weighted Regression), making Arcgis Tool using python for <b>WBGT</b> index to map heat stress hotspots, Data Preprocessing for <b>NHD</b> Natural Hazards Disclosure Report for <b>California</b> based realestate firm etc.
            
            <br></br>Eachday there was a different person wearing a different skin sometime white sometime black sometime brown with different back ground coming from a different state having a new kind of GIS challenge for me to solve and get $$.
            <br></br>I was so amazed with this kind of change in my life, With all the help from my seniors <b>(Ubaid Janjua, Ibrar Grewal, Dr. Wasim Malik)</b> and guidance from mentors like <b>(Dr. Imran,  Dr. Amin, Junaid Ab Jabbar, Bucky Roberts, John Nelson)</b> I was capable enough to execute <b>376+ projects with Rating  4.9☆/5.0☆ in 3 years</b>.
            
            <br></br>In 2019 I got an email from <b>Fiverr</b> telling me that I am notified as <b>●Level 2 Seller</b> and I was topper of <b>top 16 GIS Experts</b> on fiverr. This was a state when I felt like real that I can do anything possible in this GIS world with hard work and consistancy.
          <br></br>In Aug 2020 and May 2021, I graduated from <b>Arid University & PIAIC</b>, receiving a <b>B.S</b>. in <b>GIS</b> on the <b>Earth Systems Science</b> track and <b>P.G.D.</b> in <b>Artificial Intelligence</b>, respectively. While pursuing my undergraduate degrees, I worked as a <b>Remote Sensing Research Assistant</b> and as the main Technical Support person at <b>Geoinformatics Lab</b> under leading researcher<b>Dr. M Amin's</b> supervision. This included working on a <b>BISP Household Mapping for Pakistan</b> project in partnership with <b>SDPI Pakistan & Aurat Foundation</b>. While at Geo Labs, I was also responsible for providing technical assistance to users of <b>ESRI</b> products to fellow depts in the University.
          <br></br>I hope to continue my career in remote sensing, GIS, and Earth science. I am also passionate about doing research relating to Non-Inertial GPS, heatwave, terrestrial and Indus Delta regions, atmospheric science, and the threats we face by climate change. My goal is to increase skills in GEO-AI and utilize technology to better understand our environment.
